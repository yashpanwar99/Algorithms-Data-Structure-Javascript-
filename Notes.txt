Absolute running time of an algorithm can not be predicted, since it depends on number of factors.
    - Programming language used to implement the algorithm.
    - The computer the program runs on.
    - Other programs running at the same time.
    - Quality of operating system.

Hence we evaluate the performance of the algoroithms based on input size.
Time complexity - Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.
Space complexity - Amount of space taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.

By evaluating against input size, the analysis is not only machine independent but the comparison is also more appropriate.

Mathematic rule to represent time and space complexity.
- Big O Notation -> ( O-Notation ) - Worst Case complexity
- Omega Notation -> ( ^-Notation ) - Best Case complexity
- Theta Notation -> ( 0-Notation ) - Avg Case complexity
