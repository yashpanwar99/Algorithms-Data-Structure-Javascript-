//Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on the solution of the smaller instance of the same problem. In this, the function calls itself .
// It is a great technique to simplify the solution.
// Every recursive solution needs to have a base case- a condition to terminate the recursion.
// Recursion might simplify solving a problem, but it does not always translate to faster solution. A recusive solution might be far worse then iterative solution.
